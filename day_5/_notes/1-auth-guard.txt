🔐 What is an Auth Guard in FastAPI?
In FastAPI, an Auth Guard is not a built-in keyword.


It’s a design pattern where you use Depends() to block or allow access to a route based on authentication or authorization logic.


authentication => Login 
authorization-> Role permissions



👉 In simple words:
An Auth Guard is a dependency function that runs before the API logic and decides whether the request is allowed.

🧠 Why It’s Called a “Guard”
It guards the route
It runs before the endpoint function
If authentication fails → request is stopped
If successful → user data is passed to the route

🧠 Interview-Ready Definition

An Auth Guard in FastAPI is a dependency function implemented using Depends() that performs authentication or authorization checks before allowing access to an API endpoint.

Key Takeaways

✔ Auth Guard = Dependency
✔ Runs before route
✔ Blocks unauthorized users
✔ Clean & scalable
✔ Best practice in FastAPI
